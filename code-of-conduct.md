# The Radix Project: Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community that exemplifies the values of the Radix Project.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community & our mission as an organization

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment, whether it be directed toward individuals or other
  organizations/projects
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting 

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The Board, alongside designated organizational leaders, are responsible for clarifying & enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, and/or harmful.

They reserve the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our organization include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. This differs from official representation as is outlined in the Volunteer Contract.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the organization's leaders responsible for enforcement at
contact@radixproject.org.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All organization leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: First violation of the Code of Conduct. This could include the use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. 

**Consequence**: A private, written or verbal warning from appropriate leadership providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: Second violation; and/or a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A written warning with consequences for continued behavior will be shared with the transgressing party & the Board, as well as Human Resources. Consequences may include suspended interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in our spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: Third violation; and/or a serious violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A written incident report as well as a warning will be provided
to the Board & Human Resources. A written warning will be provided to the
transgressing party. A temporary ban will be enforced barring the transgressing individual from interaction or public communication with the community for a
period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved,
including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is
allowed during this period unless it is to provide the written report to the transgressing party. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban or
the revocation of the offender's volunteer status.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Fourth violation; and/or demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward/disparagement of classes of individuals. If you have an established history of problematic behavior, we will consider past incidents as well when considering this decision.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
organization. Volunteer status, if present, will likely also be revoked. A written warning will be provided to the transgressing party. No public or private interaction with the people involved,
including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is
allowed during this period unless it is to provide the written report to the transgressing party. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban or
the revocation of the offender's volunteer status.
